# Privacy & Terms

## Privacy

Your privacy is important! The core application (train & bus times) does not track you or retain information that could be linked to your session.

If you choose to use the experimental chat feature, your data is subject to [OpenAI's API terms](https://openai.com/policies/business-terms).

We do use an analytics service to track website usage, but this is fully anonymous and GDPR compliant.

## Terms

Usage of this application is governed by the [MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).

The TL;DR is:

- This software is provided as-is, with no warranty.
- We are not liable for any damages.
- You can do whatever you want with the code, as long as you include the original license and copyright notice.
- The code is open source and can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/cedarbaum/closingdoors.nyc)
