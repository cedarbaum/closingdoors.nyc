## Privacy

Your privacy is important! The core application (train & bus times) does not track you or retain information that could be linked to your session.

If you choose to use the experimental chat feature, your chat data is subject to [OpenAI's API terms](https://openai.com/policies/business-terms) and any directions generated are subject to [Google Maps Platform's terms](https://cloud.google.com/maps-platform/terms).

We do use an analytics service to track website usage, but this is fully anonymous. This analytics service is both [CCPA](https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa) and [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/) compliant.

Usage of this application is governed by the [MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).

The TL;DR is:

- This software is provided as-is, with no warranty.
- We are not liable for any damages.
- You can do whatever you want with the code, as long as you include the original license and copyright notice.
